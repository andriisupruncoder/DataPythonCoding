StegSpy is a steganography detection tool used for uncovering hidden data within various file formats, including images, audio, and video files. If you wish to test a file with StegSpy, you'll first need a file that potentially contains hidden data.

For the sake of this example, let's assume you already have an image named "sample.jpg" that you suspect contains steganographic content. Here's how you can use StegSpy to extract any hidden data from the image:

1. Ensure that "sample.jpg" is saved in an accessible location on your computer.
2. Download and install StegSpy from its official source or repository.
3. Launch StegSpy and navigate to the location of "sample.jpg".
4. Select the image file you want to analyze.
5. Click the "Analyze" button.
6. If StegSpy uncovers any hidden data within the image, it will display the findings in the "Output" section.
7. To extract the concealed content, click on the "Extract" button. StegSpy will then save the extracted data as a separate file in your chosen directory.

Note: It's essential to always source your files, especially those used for steganographic analysis, from trusted locations to ensure they're free from any malicious content. If you need a sample image containing hidden data for testing purposes, consider using steganographic tools to embed a message into an image yourself or source sample files from reputable cybersecurity training platforms.
