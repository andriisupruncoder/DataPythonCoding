Alright! Let's break this down:

You want to integrate LangChain with Chroma for your web app to store vector data. The link you provided leads us to instructions on how to achieve this.

In simple terms, the most important thing you'll need is the `create_pipeline()` function from the `langchain.pipeline` module. Think of this as setting up a connection between LangChain and Chroma.

Here's a straightforward explanation with a corresponding code:

**Step 1**: Think of Chroma as a library or storage where you keep your vectors (just like a bookshelf for books).

**Step 2**: To connect this "bookshelf" (Chroma) to LangChain, you'll use the `create_pipeline()` function. It's like telling LangChain, "Hey, I have this bookshelf where I want to keep my vectors."

Here's a code example to clarify this:

```python
from langchain.pipeline import create_pipeline
from chroma import Chroma

# Setting up your "bookshelf"
chroma_client = Chroma()

# Telling LangChain about your "bookshelf"
pipeline = create_pipeline(vector_store=chroma_client)

# Now, you can easily place vectors onto the shelf or take them out!
pipeline.store_vectors(vectors)            # Putting vectors on the shelf
retrieved_vectors = pipeline.retrieve_vectors(ids)   # Taking vectors out using their IDs
```

Remember, for all this to work seamlessly, you'd have to set up and run a Chroma server. The Chroma documentation will have more details on this.
