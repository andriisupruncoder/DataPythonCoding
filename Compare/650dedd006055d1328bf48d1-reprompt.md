This is provided function:

```python
def find_min_operations(A, N):
  if N == 0:
    return 0

  even_sum = 0
  for i in range(N):
    if A[i] % 2 == 0:
      even_sum += A[i]

  if even_sum % 2 == 0:
    return 0

  else:
    min_operations = N
    for i in range(N):
      if A[i] % 2 == 0:
        min_operations = min(min_operations, 1 + even_sum // A[i])

    return min_operations
```

The function currently throws a runtime error related to a missing `Solution` class.

Runtime Error:

```
Hangup (SIGHUP)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "Solution.py", line 29, in <module>
    sol = Solution()
NameError: name 'Solution' is not defined
```

Expected Output for sample array `[1, 2, 3, 2]`:
`1`

The function currently throws a runtime error related to a missing `Solution` class.

1. Correctly embed the function inside an appropriate class structure, if necessary.
2. Ensure that the function adheres to best practices regarding method definitions within classes.
3. After correcting the code, provide a brief explanation about the problem it solves and how it does it.
