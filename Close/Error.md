Sure
The error you are encountering stems from the behavior of the `this` keyword within your custom class that extends the JavaScript array. In your case, the `splice()` method expects the `this` keyword to reference an array instance, and there seems to be some context confusion.

To correctly clear the array instance, you can define a method in your custom class. Here's an example:

```javascript
class MyArray extends Array {
  clear() {
    // Instead of using the splice method directly, we'll use a while loop to pop all elements
    while (this.length) {
      this.pop();
    }
  }
}
```

With this `clear` method, you can now clear the array instance without any issues:

```javascript
const myArray = new MyArray();
myArray.push(1, 2, 3, 4);
myArray.clear();
console.log(myArray.length); // Outputs: 0
```

Using the `pop()` method within a loop in the `clear` function avoids potential recursive pitfalls and ensures the array is cleared without errors.

I hope this helps! If you have further questions or concerns, please let me know.

I've opted for the `pop()` method in a loop to ensure clarity and simplicity.
